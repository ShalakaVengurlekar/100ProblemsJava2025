Problem Statement: Phone Book Management System
You are required to implement a phone book management system that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage contacts. Each contact has a name, phone number, and email address.

Class Definitions:
Contact:

Attributes:
contactId (int): Unique ID for each contact.
name (String): The name of the contact.
phoneNumber (String): The phone number of the contact.
email (String): The email address of the contact.
PhoneBook:

Contains a list of contacts and supports the following operations:
Methods:
searchByName():

This method takes the name of the contact and searches for all contacts with a matching name (case-insensitive). If no contact is found, print "No contact found with the given name."
Parameters:
name (String): Name of the contact to search.
Output:
Returns a list of contacts with matching names or a message if no contacts are found.
addContact():

This method adds a new contact to the phone book. If a contact with the same phone number already exists, the contact is not added, and a message "Duplicate phone number found" is printed.
Parameters:
Contact object: Contact to be added.
Output:
The method prints "Contact added successfully" or "Duplicate phone number found."
deleteContact():

This method deletes a contact by the phone number. If the contact is not found, print "Contact not found."
Parameters:
phoneNumber (String): The phone number of the contact to be deleted.
Output:
The method prints "Contact deleted successfully" or "Contact not found."
sortContactsByName():

This method sorts all contacts alphabetically by their names.
Output:
The sorted list of contacts, with each contact's name, phone number, and email.

Name: Alice, Phone: 1234567890, Email: alice@gmail.com
Name: Alice, Phone: 1122334455, Email: alice123@yahoo.com
Contact deleted successfully
Sorted contacts:
