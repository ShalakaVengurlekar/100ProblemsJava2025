You are tasked with designing a system to manage and
analyze employee performance data in a company. The
system involves two classes:
Class Employee:
Attributes:
- employeeld (int)
- employeeName (String)
- companyName (String)
- projectCount (int)
- projectList (List of Project objects)
Class Project:
Attributes:
- projectName (String): Name of the project.
- rating (int): Employee Rating for that project.
Task-1:
Write a method that identifies and returns all unique
ratings that an employee has received, ensuring that no
duplicate ratings are included.
This method takes two arguments: a list of Employees and
employeeld as an argument and returns the distinct
project ratings received by the employee, eliminating any
duplicates.
If the employeeld does not exist, the method should print
"No Employee Found."
Task-2:
This method calculates the average project ratings for each
employee and identifies those whose average is above a
given threshold.
This method takes two arguments: a list of Employees and
an integer threshold.
The method should return a list of employee names who
have an average rating above the specified threshold.
If no such employees exist, the method should print "No
Employee Found."
Note:
You can use/refer to the below-given sample input and
output to verify your solution.
Write the code for accepting the inputs and printing the
outputs. Don't use any static test or formatting for printing
the result. Just invoke the method and print the result.
