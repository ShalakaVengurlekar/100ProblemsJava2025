You are tasked with designing a system to manage an inventory of Holi Festival Items for a retail store. 

Class Decorations: 
Attributes: 
decorationld (int): Unique ID for each decoration item. 
decorationName (String): Name of the decoration item. 
type (String): Type of the decoration (e.g.. Lights. Colours, Balloons). 
quantityAvailable (int): Number of units currently available. 
pricePerUnit (double): Price per unit for the decoration. 
Create getters, setters, and a constructor for the above Decoration class. 
The two non-static methods described below should be created in a DecorationService class: 

Task 1: Calculate Total Stock Value for a Type 
Create a non-static method that calculates and returns the total stock value of decorations of a specific type. 
The method should accept a string barameter type of decoration: 
It should sum up the stock value (pricePerUnit quantityAvailable) for all decorations of the specified type. 
If no decorations are found for the given type, throw a custom exception, called TypeNotFoundException with the message "Type Not Found" without the quotation marks. 

Task 2: Find Decorations Below Stock Threshold 
Create a non-static method that retrieves a list of decoration names that have stock below a certain threshold. 
The method should accept an integer parameter for the stock threshold. 
It should return a list of decoration names with quantityAvailable less than the given threshold. 
If no decorations meet the criteria, throw a custom exception called OutOfStock Exception, with the message "No Decorations Below Stock Threshold".

Note: 
-Write the code for accepting inputs, printing outputs and calling the non-static methods in the main method from the Decoration Tester class. 
-You can refer to the sample input/output below to verify your solution. 
-Don't use any static test or formatting for printing the result. Just invoke the methods and print the result. 
-All comparisons should be case-insensitive.
