Question 1: Hospital Management System
Design a system to manage records of doctors and patients in a hospital. The system should involve two classes: Doctor and Patient. A doctor can have multiple patients. Your task is to implement a solution that will maintain a list of Patient objects within the Doctor class and perform specific operations.

Class Doctor:
Attributes:

doctorId (int)
doctorName (String)
specialization (String)
patients (List of Patient objects)
Class Patient:
Attributes:

patientId (int)
patientName (String)
illness (String)
Methods in Doctor Class:
getUniqueIllnesses()

This method identifies and returns all unique illnesses that patients of a particular doctor are suffering from, sorted alphabetically. It takes two arguments: a list of doctor objects and doctorId. If no doctor is found, print "Doctor Not Found".
getDoctorsBySpecialization()

This method retrieves all doctors with a specific specialization and returns a list of their names. It takes two arguments: a list of doctor objects and the specialization. If no doctors are found, print "No Doctors Found".
