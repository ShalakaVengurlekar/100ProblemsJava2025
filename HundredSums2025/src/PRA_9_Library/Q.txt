Here’s a different scenario that still involves Java classes, methods, and collections, but in a new context:

### Problem Statement:

**Library Management System**

Design a `Book` class that keeps track of each book's ISBN (International Standard Book Number), title, author, and the list of reviews given by readers. Implement two methods in the `Library` class to process books:

1. **booksWithAverageReviewAboveThreshold(List<Book> books, double threshold)**:
   - This method should return a list of book titles whose average review rating is greater than the specified threshold.

2. **booksWithMostUniqueReviewers(List<Book> books)**:
- This method should return a list of book titles that have been reviewed by the highest number of unique reviewers.

Your program should:
- Accept input for a list of books, each having an ISBN, title, author, and multiple reviews.
- For each book, reviews consist of the reviewer’s name and the review rating they give (1-5).
- The program should then ask for a threshold value to return the list of books with an average review rating above this threshold.
- It should also return the list of books with the highest number of unique reviewers.

**Input**:
- The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of books.
- For each book:
- A string `ISBN`.
- A string `title`.
- A string `author`.
- An integer `m` representing the number of reviews the book has received.
    - For the next `m` lines, a string `reviewerName` and an integer `reviewRating` (1-5).
    - The next line contains a double `threshold`, representing the average review threshold.

    **Output**:
    - List of book titles with average review ratings above the threshold.
    - List of book titles with the highest number of unique reviewers.

    ### Example:

    **Input**:
    ```
    3
    978-3-16-148410-0
    The Great Adventure
    John Smith
    3
    Alice
    5
    Bob
    4
    Alice
    3
    978-1-86197-876-9
    Mystery in the Night
    Jane Doe
    2
    Carol
    5
    Dave
    4
    978-0-14-044913-6
    The Art of War
    Sun Tzu
    3
    Eve
    4
    Alice
    4
    Frank
    5
    4.0
    ```

    **Output**:
    ```
    Books with average review rating above threshold:
    Mystery in the Night
    The Art of War

    Books with the most unique reviewers:
    The Art of War
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - "The Great Adventure" has reviews by Alice (twice) and Bob, but only Bob's review is unique. Its average review rating is (5 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 4.0, so it’s equal to the threshold.
    - "Mystery in the Night" has reviews by Carol and Dave with an average of (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5, which is above the threshold.
    - "The Art of War" has reviews by Eve, Alice, and Frank, with an average of (4 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 4.33, which is also above the threshold and has the most unique reviewers.

    ### Problem Focus:
    This problem emphasizes:
    - Handling a `Book` class with attributes like ISBN, title, author, and a list of reviews.
    - Managing collections (using `HashMap`, `List`, and `Set`).
    - Working with reviewer names to find unique reviewers and calculating averages.
