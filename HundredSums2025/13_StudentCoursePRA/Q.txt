Problem 2: Student Course Enrollment
Objective: Create a system to manage student course enrollments in a university. The system should involve two classes: Course and University. A University can have multiple Course objects stored in a HashMap where the key is the course code, and the value is a Course object.

Classes:

Class Course:
Attributes:
courseCode (String)
courseName (String)
instructor (String)
enrolledStudents (HashSet of student names)
Class University:
Attributes:
universityName (String)
courses (HashMap of course codes to Course objects)
Methods:
getCoursesByInstructor(String instructor): Retrieve a HashSet of course names taught by a given instructor.
getStudentsEnrolledInCourse(String courseCode): Retrieve a HashSet of student names enrolled in a given course.
getCoursesWithStudentCount(): Retrieve a HashMap where each key is a course name and the value is the number of students enrolled.
Example Input:

University name: "Tech University"
Courses:
CourseCode: "CS101", CourseName: "Introduction to Computer Science", Instructor: "Dr. Smith", EnrolledStudents: {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}
CourseCode: "MA102", CourseName: "Calculus I", Instructor: "Dr. Jones", EnrolledStudents: {"Alice", "David"}
CourseCode: "CS102", CourseName: "Data Structures", Instructor: "Dr. Smith", EnrolledStudents: {"Charlie", "Eve"}
