Hereâ€™s a similar problem with a focus on a **Gym Membership Management System** using a similar structure to the "Student Course Enrollment" system you described.

### **Problem 2: Gym Membership Management**
**Objective**: Design and implement a system to manage gym memberships and track class enrollments. The system should involve two main classes: **GymClass** and **Gym**. A Gym can have multiple GymClass objects stored in a `HashMap`, where the key is the class code and the value is a GymClass object.

---

### **Classes**:

#### **Class GymClass**:
**Attributes**:
- `String classCode`: The unique code for the gym class.
- `String className`: The name of the gym class (e.g., "Yoga", "Strength Training").
- `String instructor`: The name of the instructor teaching the class.
- `HashSet<String> enrolledMembers`: A set of gym member names who are enrolled in the class.

#### **Class Gym**:
**Attributes**:
- `String gymName`: The name of the gym.
- `HashMap<String, GymClass> gymClasses`: Stores the gym classes, where the key is the class code and the value is a `GymClass` object.

**Methods**:
- `HashSet<String> getClassesByInstructor(String instructor)`: Retrieve a `HashSet` of class names taught by a given instructor.
- `HashSet<String> getMembersEnrolledInClass(String classCode)`: Retrieve a `HashSet` of gym member names enrolled in a given class.
- `HashMap<String, Integer> getClassEnrollmentCount()`: Retrieve a `HashMap` where each key is a class name, and the value is the number of members enrolled.

### **Example Input**:

**Gym name**: "FitLife Gym"

**Gym Classes**:
1. **ClassCode**: "Y101", **ClassName**: "Yoga", **Instructor**: "John Doe", **EnrolledMembers**: {"Emily", "Mike", "Sara"}
2. **ClassCode**: "ST102", **ClassName**: "Strength Training", **Instructor**: "Jane Smith", **EnrolledMembers**: {"Sara", "Jake"}
3. **ClassCode**: "Z103", **ClassName**: "Zumba", **Instructor**: "John Doe", **EnrolledMembers**: {"Emily", "Lucy", "Jake"}

---

### **Expected Operations**:

- Retrieve all classes taught by a specific instructor, e.g., all classes taught by "John Doe".
- Retrieve the list of gym members enrolled in a specific class, e.g., members in the "Yoga" class.
- Retrieve a summary of classes with the number of enrolled members for each class.

---

### **Example Output**:

```java
// Classes taught by "John Doe":
Classes taught by John Doe: Yoga, Zumba

// Members enrolled in "Yoga" class:
Members in Yoga class: Emily, Mike, Sara

// Class enrollment count:
Yoga: 3 members
Strength Training: 2 members
Zumba: 3 members
```

### **Guidelines**:
- Use `HashSet` to store gym members enrolled in each class to avoid duplicate enrollments.
- Use `HashMap` to store the collection of `GymClass` objects in the `Gym`.
- Implement the methods to retrieve classes by instructor, enrolled members, and class enrollment counts.
