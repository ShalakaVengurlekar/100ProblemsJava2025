Question 3: Library Management System with Genre
Design a system to manage records of books and genres in a library. The system should involve two classes: Genre and Book. A genre can have multiple books. Your task is to implement a solution that will maintain a list of Book objects within the Genre class and perform specific operations.

Class Genre:
Attributes:

genreId (int)
genreName (String)
books (Map of book ID to Book objects)
Class Book:
Attributes:

bookId (int)
title (String)
authorName (String)
Methods in Genre Class:
getBooksByAuthor()

This method retrieves and returns a list of book titles written by a specific author within a genre, sorted alphabetically. It takes three arguments: a list of genre objects, genreId, and the authorName. If no genre is found, print "Genre Not Found". If no books are found by the author, print "No Books Found".
getGenresByBookId()

This method finds all genres that contain a specific book ID and returns a list of genre names. It takes two arguments: a list of genre objects and the bookId. If no genres are found containing the book, print "No Genres Found".
